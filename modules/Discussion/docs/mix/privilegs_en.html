  <br />  <b><big>Privileges of team members and administrators</big></b><br />
  <br />
  There are many options (u2u, e-mail, IP-address, prioritization, online status etc.) in the forum
  which are always available for team members or administrators. It is no matter whether these
  options for the normal users are activated. So it therefore isn't a malfunction if options which
  are deactivated for normal users are utilizable for moderators or administrators. This has been
  chosen consciously so.<br />
  <br />
  Moderator- and administrator-accounts are different, too. An administrator nearly can use
  everything even if disabled, a moderator only a few well selected things.<br />
  <br />
  Therefor it is usefull to test your new forum with many different account (anonymous, user,
  moderator, super moderator, administrator) to see, what each of them can do or see.<br />
  <br />
  <b>One change between the XForum and mxBoard:</b> you doesn't have the possibility any longer to
  set the status "administrator" in the forum to a member which isn't really an administrator onto
  the pragmaMx system. The highest possibil status for "non-nuke administrators" is "Super
  Moderator"<br />
