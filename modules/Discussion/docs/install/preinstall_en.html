  <br />  <b><big>1.1 Before the installation</big></b><br />
  <br />
  Some points to which must be paid attention before the installation are listed here:<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <i><b>Compatibility and installation prerequisites:</b></i><br />

  <ol>
    <li>The mxBoard has been <b>developed exclusively for pragmaMx</b> 1.12 and higher.There is no
    support for other CMS at the moment. </li>

    <li>The forum was tested on the PHP versions 4.3.x. to 5.3.1. No statement can be made about
    the full operability at other PHP versions. </li>

    <li>Using PHP to send emails should be allowed on your system to use all functions of the forum
    (most provider allow this, but some of them also block this). So if your forum is not allowed
    to send emails via PHP, the whole notice-function via email doesn't work. This is not an error
    of the mxBoard-Modul!<br /></li>

    <li>Administration rights are required on the pragmaMx-System. </li>

    <li>There must be access to the SQL database .</li>
  </ol><br />
  <i><b>The upload of the files:</b></i><br />

  <ol>
    <li>Copy the content of the "html"-directory into your pragmaMx root-directory.</li>

    <li>Make a <b>changemode 664 or 666</b> (depending on your provider) to the following
    files<b> </b> (some providers need chmod 777 to have write-access to the files!):
    <b>settings.php</b></li>
  </ol><br />
  <i><b>What has to be taken into account at an upgrade of the XForum to the mxBoard:</b></i><br />

  <ol>
    <li>The XForum-module must be into your nuke modules-directory until upgrade is complete. The
    "settings.php" is needed from this directory.</li>

    <li>In the "settings.php" of the XForum, the full webpath to the pragmaMx root-directory must
    be set correctly in "Full Site URL:". If your main domain is forwarded to "somewhere else",
    here you have to set the site-url to the "somewhere else" and not to your main
    domain!<br /></li>

    <li><b>IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO BACKUP THE DATABASE BEFOR UPGRADING!</b>  The whole
    database-structure will be changed by the install-script. There were no problems until now with
    this script, but we can't guaranty for this! Therefore the install-script allow you to call the
    "BackupDB"-function from the pragmaMx-Administratormenu. Why to backup the whole DB? It's very
    simple: if there are any problems with the update you can refresh you whole nuke system without
    having trouble to replace only the forums tables of the database. It is also a good idea to
    make a second backup of the database using phpMyAdmin or something like this.</li>

    <li>All old links on your pragmaMx system pointing onto the old forum module
    (modules.php?name=XForum), must be changed into "modules.php?name=mxBoard". The old XForum will
    not work anymore with the new database.<br /></li>
  </ol><br />
  <b><i>Further informations:</i><br /></b><br />
  The module name per default isn't limited to "mxBoard", the folder can be renamed arbitrarily.
  This has the advantage that several forums can be independently of each other going on and are so
  free switchable also for different user groups. If you should have changed the module name, they
  must make this also in the forum center block.<br />
