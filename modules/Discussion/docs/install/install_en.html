    <li><a href="#new">1st installation</a>   - there is no mxBoard-forum onto your system</li>

    <li><a href="#expand">extension installation</a>   - another mxBoard forum shall be installed

  <b>Note:</b> The option instruction always refers to the module name "mxBoard". If you should use
  another module name, then you must change all "mxBoard" calls against your module name.
  <span class="c1">We consider, that you have read the notes "<a href="preinstall_en.html">before
  the installation</a>"!</span><br />
  <br />
  <b><i>1. 1st installation</i></b><br />

  <ol>
    <li>You must be logged in as administrator on your system</li>

    <li>Start the installation-script with this link:
    <u>http://www.YourDomain.com/modules.php?name=mxBoard&amp;file=install </u>(if you have any
    problems with this script, please read the part at the end of this page!).</li>

    <li>Coose your desired language and the operation "install"..</li>

    <li>"Step 1". Now you see the settings of you pragmaMx system. Please don't change anything
    except you know what you do! Now click "Next".</li>

    <li>"Step 2". If  the installation-script get access to your database, you can click "next" and
    the forum will be insert into your database.</li>

    <li>"Step 3". Database was created. Now there will be some default-values (Smilies, Themes ...)
    be insert into your database. Click "Next"</li>

    <li>If everything worked well, you should be forwarded to the new forum. Installation is

  <b><i>2. Extension installation<br /></i></b><br />
  "mxBoard2" is accepted as an additional module name here. This name has to be replaced by your
  module name if necessary.<br />
  <br />

  <ol>
    <li>You must be logged in as administrator on your system</li>

    <li>Start the installation-script with this link:
    <u>http://www.YourDomain.com/modules.php?name=mxBoard&amp;file=install </u>(if you have any
    problems with this script, please read the part at the end of this page!).</li>

    <li>Coose your desired language and the operation "install"..</li>

    <li>"Step 1". Now you see the settings of you pragmaMx system. Please don't change anything
    except you know what you do! Only thing you HAVE TO CHANGE is the "mxBoard Prefix". If you
    allready have an mxBoard-Modul running on your system, the prefix "mxBoard" will be used by the
    first forum. So change this prefix into something unused, lets say "mxBoard2". Now click
    "Next".</li>

    <li>"Step 2". If  the installation-script get access to your database, you can click "next" and
    the forum will be insert into your database.</li>

  <b><i>3. Upgrade</i></b><br />
  <br />

  <ol>
    <li>You must be logged in as administrator on your system.</li>

    <li>Deactivate the XForum-module on your system (you do this in the administratormenu of your
    system). This keeps "normal users" away from your forum while upgrading it to the mxBoard, but
    it doesn't keep other administrators of your system away from it. So make sure noone access
    your forums-db until upgrade to mxBoard is complete!<br /></li>

    <li>Start the installation-script with this link:
    <u>http://www.YourDomain.com/modules.php?name=mxBoard&amp;file=install </u>(if you have any
    problems with this script, please read the part at the end of this page!).</li>

    <li>Coose your desired language and the operation "install"..</li>

    <li>"Step 1". Now you see the settings of you pragmaMx system. Please don't change anything
    except you know what you do! DO NOT CHANGE THE "mxBoard Prefix"! Now click "Next".</li>

    <li>"Step 2". If  the installation-script get access to your database, it points you to backup
    your database. PLEASE DO SO before you click "Next". Now the old database will be changed to
    the new database-structure of the mxBoard-Module.</li>

    <li>"Step 3". Database was created. Now there will be some default-values (Smilies, Themes ...)
    be insert into your database. Click "Next"</li>

    <li>If everything worked well, you should be forwarded to the new forum. Installation is
    completed hereby.</li>

    <li>Please read now the part "After the installation".</li>

<i><b>Problems with the installation script <br/>
</b></i><br/>
On some pragmaMx systems, an administrator is not recognized as administrator
by the installation script. We do not know why this happens on some systems,
but when it happens you are not able to install the mxBoard-module with the
normal installation-script<br/>
<br/>
For this case we have build a "backdoor" installation-script using the "admin.php",
so you should not have problems anymore using this second way.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>IMPORTANT:</b></font> If you have choose another
module name than "mxBoard", you have to modify the installation-script  "admin/modules/install.php"
on line 20 to fit for your module name. Otherwise installation will abord!<br/>
<br/>
The "backdoor" installation-script will be called with the following link:<u>
http://www.YourDomain.com/admin.php?op=Board/install</u><br/>
<br/>
All other steps are equal to the normal installation.<br/>
